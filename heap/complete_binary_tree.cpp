//tree will be filled up level by level and from left side
//array represantation of complete binary tree
//i-th node left, right can be found:
//i*2+1 = left
//i*2+2 = right
//node can be found from left/right using:
//(i-1)/2
//heap is array represantation of complete binary tree
//max heap always return max val, node is most max, left, right is smaller than node val
//min heap always return min val, node is smallest, left, right is bigger than node val
